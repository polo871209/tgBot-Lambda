### what I learn
  First of all, this is the first (python)project that I need to deploy different component. How to communicate between resource, permissions, API request, etc... Also, try to breakdown code using OOP.  
  I definitly learn that **no matter how hard this might think, there will be a solution eventually.**  
  Overall it's still an one man band, hopefully in the future I can become a developer and build big projects with others.
